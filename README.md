# regression-final-report
Title :
Use logistic regression to analyze the customer's credit card default records.
Method :
First step,I used the Lasso method to choose the important variable,and discard the not useful variable step by step.
Second step,I used the logistic regression to analyze the credit card default records and to predict the customer's future behavior by the remaining variable.
Final step,I made a ROC curve to show that this measure is useful.
p.s I made a confusion matrix to calculate the accuracy,but I did not put it on the report at that time.
